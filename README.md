# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction-Using-KNN
This notebook uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict whether a loan applicant is eligible based on demographic, financial, and credit-related features.

## 🏦 What This Notebook Does

* Loads and preprocesses loan applicant dataset
* Handles missing values and encodes categorical data
* Splits data into training and testing sets
* Trains a KNN classifier
* Evaluates accuracy and performance metrics
* Tests model predictions on sample input

---

## 📁 Files

* `loandetect_knn.ipynb` — complete classification workflow
* Loan dataset (CSV) — required

---

## 🔧 Requirements

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook loandetect_knn.ipynb
```

Ensure the dataset file is in the correct directory.
